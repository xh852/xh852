### Hello! This is Xu (Shoo)! ☺️

I graduated with master degree in data science from [NYU Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/). Before studying data science, I earned my Bachelor Degree of Art in Mathematics and Economics at NYU Courant Institution.

My interests in data science center around Machine Learning and NLP, and here are relevant courses I have taken at CDS:
- Introduction to Data Science
- Probability and Statistics for Data Science
- Machine Learning
- Big Data
- Natural Language Understanding (by Sam Bowman)
- Natural Language Processing
- Machine Learning for Healthcare
- Advanced Python for data science
- Causal Inferece
- Text as Data (R)
- Capstone (internship with Zillow group) 

I am also fluent in Python, R and SQL.

In terms of natural language, I am flent in Mandarin and English and am studying Cantonese - 我白話講得麻麻哋 ;)

I am now working as a data engineer at [O-Lab](https://www.nyuolab.org/) at NYU Langone Hospital. I worked at NYU Marron Institution of Urban Management as a data science research fellow. Our team worked with Illinios Department of Corrention and my responsibility was to build an interactive dashboard reflecting prison and parole population data.

During my 5 to 9, I love bouldering, hiking, baking, film photography and hanging out with my dog 🐶 Kimchi! He is a lovely Jindo mix adopted in Feb 2022 from South Korea. \

I am not sure if he loves coding and data science like I do, but he loves chicken 🍗 and loooong walk outside and shniff around !!
