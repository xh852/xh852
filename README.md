### Hello! This is Xu (Shoo)! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I am a second-year master student at [NYU Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/). Before studying data science, I earned my Bachelor Degree of Art in Mathematics and Economics at NYU Courant Institution.

My interests in data science center around Machine Learning and NLP, and here relavant courses I have taken at CDS:
- Introduction to Data Science
- Probability and Statistics for Data Science
- Machine Learning
- Big Data
- Natural Language Understanding (by Sam Bowman)
- Natural Lanaguage Processing
- Machine Learning for Healthcare 

I am also fluent in Python, R and SQL.

I am currently working at NYU Marron Institution of Urban Management as a data science research fellow. Our team is working with Illinios Department of Corrention and my responsibility is to build an interactive dashboard reflecting prison and parole population data.

Outside the classroom, I love hiking, baking, film photography and hanging out with my dog üê∂ Kimchi! <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57966939/207690507-dbcd2365-10f8-4951-beb8-4db650549750.jpeg"  width="150" height="200" />
He never told me he loves coding and data science like I do. But he loves chicken üçó and outside!!
